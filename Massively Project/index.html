									<p> <b><h2>My name is Rodney Gottschalk </h2></b>
										<br></br>
										This portfolio was inspired by both my desire to create a website hosted on GitHub Pages and as a medium for learning HTML5/CSS.
										<br></br>
										I’ve always had a desire to build, analyze, and connect – but due to perceived pressures, I compromised with my passion to create a 
										stable financial foundation and I pursued my B.S. in Industrial & Systems Engineering (ISE). ISE appealed to my inquisitive nature and provided 
										a framework for	thinking about the world in a series of interconnected systems. Immediately following graduation, I was hired by a Data 
										Analytics Consulting Firm and relocated to Bangalore, India for 9 months. While working as a data consultant offered me an environment filled 
										with diverse challenges, people, and continuous learning - something was still missing.
										<br></br>
										The novelty of solving problems for the Fortune 500 quickly faded and was replaced with a desire for more. I noticed that my conversations were very
										different from those of my colleagues, where they enjoyed talking about optimizing neural networks and all the associated math – I ventured towards conversations focused on the
										intersection of people, place, and perspective to solve complex social issues. Conversations like these have activated a desire within me to move beyond simply solving problems. 
										As a result, I’ve begun to understand how empowering it is to utilize my platform and skills to inspire others to create positive change, to personify compassion and empathy, and to promote community
										development within the marginalized communities that raised me.
										<br></br>
										I am passionate about augmenting my technical background by developing a greater understanding of both city planning and community development. 
										By expanding my knowledge base, I hope to become a better problem solver and innovator in the urban planning sector. 
										My academic and career goals include exploring and performing cutting-edge research in the field and applying my learning to communities within Oklahoma. I believe
										that Oklahoma will continue to experience large growth over the next few years and I’d like to be a part of the efforts driving this growth. 
										Specifically, I’d like to aide and shape the growth happening in either Oklahoma City or Tulsa.
										<br></br>
